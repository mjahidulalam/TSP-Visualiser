Web app created using Plotly Dash and Flask to help visualise algorithms used to solve the classic Travelling Salesperson problem. The algorithms currently implemented include the following:
- Nearest Neighbor
- Nearest Insertion
- Farthest Insertion
- 2-opt

I am curently working on adding more algorithms to the app.

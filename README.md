# Travelling Salesperson Problem Visualizer
Web app created using Plotly Dash and Flask to help visualise algorithms used to solve the classic Travelling Salesperson problem. The algorithms currently implemenmted include the following:
- Nearest Neighbor
- Nearest Insertion
- Farthest Insertion
- 2-opt

I am curently working on adding more algorithms to the app.
